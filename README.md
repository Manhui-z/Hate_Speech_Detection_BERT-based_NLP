# Hate_Speech_Detection_BERT-based_NLP
NLP models for Text Classification (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Fine-tuned BERT)

The term hate speech is understood as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that attacks or uses derogatory or discriminatory language against a person or group based on what they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, sex or another identity factor. In this problem, I will take you through a hate speech detection model with Machine Learning and Python.

Hate Speech Detection is generally a task of sentiment classification. A model that can classify hate speech from a certain piece of text can be achieved by training it on a data that is generally used to classify sentiments. So for the task of hate speech detection model, I will use the Twitter tweets to identify tweets containing  Hate speech.

Applied feature extraction techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, BERT), built machine learning/deep learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Fine-tune BERT), evaluated model by confusion matrix, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC curve.
